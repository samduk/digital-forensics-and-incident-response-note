### Incident Response 

- Organizationz need to have a workig knowledge of the incident response process. This process outlines the general flow of an incident and general actions that are taken at each stage. 
- Organizations need to have access to personnel who form the nucleus of any incident response capability. Once a team is organized, a formalized plan and associated processes need to be created. This written plan and processes form the orderly structure that an organization can follow during an incident. 
- With this framework in place, the plan has to be continually evaluated, tested , and improved as new threats immerge. Utilizing this framework will position organizations to be prepared for the unfortunate reality that many organizations have already faced, an incident that compromises their security. 

### The incident response process 

- Each incident starts with the first time the organization becomes aware of an event or series of events indicative of malicious activity. this detetion can come in the form of a security control alert or external party informing the organization of a potential security issue. Once alerted, the organization moves through analyzing the incident through containment measures to bring the information system back to normal operations. The following figure shows how these flow in a cycle with <b>Preparation</b> as a starting point.  Closer examination reveals that every incident is used to better prepare the organization for future incidents as the <b>Post Incident Activity </b> and is utilized in the preparation for the next incident. 

Preparation -> Detection -> Analysis -> Containment -> Eradication and Recovery-> Post Incident Activity -> Preparation 

The incident response process can be broken down into six distinct phases, each with a set of actions the organization can take to address the incident. 

1. Preparation: Without good preparation, any subsequent incident response is going to be disorganized and has the potential to make the incident worse. Some of the critical components of preparation are the creation of an incident response plan. Once a plan is in place with the necessary staffing, ensure that personnel detailed with incident response duties are properly trained. This includes both processes, procedures, and any additional tools necessary for the investigation of an incident. In addition to the plan, tools such as forensics hardware and software should be acquired and incorporated into the overall process. Finally regular exercises should be conducted to ensure that the organization is trained and familiar with the process. 

2. Detection: The detection of potential incidents is a complex endeavor. Depending on the size of the organization, they may have over 100 million separate events per day. Couple this mountain of events with other security controls constantly alerting to activity and you have a situation where analyst are inundated with data and have to subsequently sift out the valuable pieces of signal from the vastnesss of network noise. Even today's cutting
